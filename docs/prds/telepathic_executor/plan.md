# Plan: Telepathic File-Bridge Executor

> Source PRD: docs/prds/telepathic_executor/telepathic_executor.md

## Architectural Decisions

Durable decisions that apply across all phases:

- **File channel**: `ai/action.json` (Python -> Lua), `ai/action_error.json` (Lua -> Python on failure). No separate ack file - deletion of `action.json` is the completion signal.
- **Action schema**: `action.json` is a JSON object with a top-level `"actions"` array. Each item has `kind` (string), `target_ids` (int array), `target_key` (string or null), and `order` (int array). Python writes the full sequence atomically.
- **Bridge key**: `instance_id` in `GameObservation` is identical to `card.ID` in Lua. This is the lookup key the Lua executor uses to find card objects - no screen positions, no display indices.
- **Stable-state completion signal**: The Lua executor does not delete `action.json` immediately after queuing the last `G.FUNCS.*` call. It appends a final `G.E_MANAGER` condition event that polls `G.STATE` and fires only once the game has settled into a known actionable state. The actionable states are defined as a constant set in `ai_executor`: `SELECTING_HAND`, `SHOP`, `BLIND_SELECT`, and all pack states (`TAROT_PACK`, `PLANET_PACK`, `SPECTRAL_PACK`, `BUFFOON_PACK`, `STANDARD_PACK`). Scoring periods, interest screens, and ante transitions are not in this set and cause the condition event to keep waiting.
- **Exporter readiness gate**: `live_state_exporter` no longer treats `action.json` deletion as the sole write trigger. Instead, it polls a very cheap in-memory readiness predicate and only promotes a fresh canonical `live_state.json` snapshot when the game appears input-ready. The first candidate predicate is controller-based: `not G.CONTROLLER.locked`, `not G.CONTROLLER.interrupt.focus`, and `(G.GAME.STOP_USE or 0) == 0`. If needed, one or two tiny presence checks may be added later, but full observation reads are not used to determine readiness.
- **Startup write**: On game load, before any action has ever been submitted, the exporter performs one unconditional write so Python has an initial observation to act on. After that it switches to the readiness-gated model.
- **Separate mods**: `ai_executor` and `live_state_exporter` are independent mods. Each can be installed, disabled, or modified without touching the other.
- **Protocol unchanged**: The `Executor` Python protocol (`execute(action: GameAction) -> None`) is not modified. `EpisodeRunner` and `Validator` are not touched.
- **Lua trusts Python**: The Lua executor performs no re-validation. It executes what the queue says and writes an error file if execution fails at the game API level.

## Phase 1: Action Contract

**User stories**: 22, 23, 24

### What to build

Define the shared vocabulary that both sides of the file channel will depend on. This is pure Python - no file I/O, no Lua, no running game required.

Introduce an `ActionKind` module that declares string constants for every valid action kind: `play_hand`, `discard`, `buy_shop_item`, `sell_joker`, `reroll_shop`, `leave_shop`, `select_blind`, `skip_blind`, `pick_pack_item`, `skip_pack`, `use_consumable`, `reorder_jokers`, `reorder_hand`. Policy code imports from this module rather than using bare strings.

Extend `GameAction` with two new fields: `target_ids` (tuple of ints, default empty) and `order` (tuple of ints, default empty). The existing `target` string field is retained but superseded by `target_ids` and `target_key` in the new schema.

Define and test the JSON serialization shape for `action.json`: every `ActionKind` constant produces a correctly structured action object, `target_ids` and `order` serialize as integer arrays, `target_key` serializes as string or null.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `ActionKind` module exists and covers every action in the PRD
- [ ] `GameAction` carries `target_ids` and `order` fields with correct types and defaults
- [ ] Every `ActionKind` constant round-trips through JSON serialization without mutation
- [ ] `GameAction` serializes to the documented `action.json` action object shape for each kind
- [ ] Existing policy and runtime tests still pass without modification

## Phase 2: FileExecutor

**User stories**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 25, 26, 27, 33

### What to build

Implement `FileExecutor`, a concrete `Executor` that closes the Python side of the file channel. It accepts a paths argument consistent with `BalatroPaths` to locate the `ai/` directory.

On `execute`, it serializes the action as a one-item queue and writes `action.json` atomically (write to temp, then rename). It then polls on a configurable interval until either `action.json` is absent (success) or `action_error.json` appears (failure). On failure it reads the error file, raises a typed `ExecutorError` with the reason, and cleans up the error file. On timeout it raises as well.

A companion `execute_sequence` method accepts a pre-built list of `GameAction` and writes them as a multi-item queue in one atomic write. The runtime loop continues to call `execute` for single actions; `execute_sequence` is available for future policy upgrades.

All tests use a real temporary filesystem directory - no mocks, no running game.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `FileExecutor` implements the `Executor` protocol without protocol changes
- [ ] `action.json` is written atomically and contains a valid `"actions"` array
- [ ] `FileExecutor` returns cleanly when `action.json` is deleted
- [ ] `FileExecutor` raises `ExecutorError` when `action_error.json` appears, including the reason from the file
- [ ] `FileExecutor` raises on timeout if neither signal appears within the configured window
- [ ] `execute_sequence` writes all actions as a single atomic queue
- [ ] Poll interval and timeout are configurable for fast test execution

## Phase 3: Lua Executor - All Game Actions

**User stories**: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39

### What to build

Build the complete `ai_executor` Lua mod. This is the meat of the feature and the first point at which a real end-to-end run becomes possible.

The mod hooks into `love.update` and polls for `action.json` each frame. When the file appears and the mod is not already processing, it reads and parses the JSON queue, then processes each action in order via `G.E_MANAGER:add_event`. Each action handler locates target card objects by iterating the appropriate `CardArea.cards` table and matching `card.ID` to the instance IDs declared in the action.

Action handlers to implement: `play_hand` (select by `target_ids`, then `G.FUNCS.play_cards_from_highlighted`), `discard` (select by `target_ids`, then `G.FUNCS.discard_cards_from_highlighted`), `buy_shop_item` (find in shop areas by `target_ids[0]`, then `G.FUNCS.buy_from_shop`), `sell_joker` (find in jokers by `target_ids[0]`, then `card:sell_card`), `reroll_shop` (`G.FUNCS.reroll_shop`), `leave_shop` (`G.FUNCS.toggle_shop`), `select_blind` (find blind by `target_key`, then `G.FUNCS.select_blind`), `skip_blind` (find blind by `target_key`, then `G.FUNCS.skip_blind`), `pick_pack_item` (find in `G.pack_cards` by `target_ids[0]`, then `G.FUNCS.use_card`), `skip_pack` (`G.FUNCS.skip_booster`), `use_consumable` (`target_ids[0]` is consumable, `target_ids[1:]` are hand card targets, select targets then `G.FUNCS.use_card`).

After the last action event is queued, a final `G.E_MANAGER` condition event is appended. This event polls `G.STATE` on each game tick and fires only when the state has settled into the actionable set (defined as a named constant in the mod). On fire, it deletes `action.json`. On any handler error, the mod writes `action_error.json` with the action kind and reason, halts queue processing, and does not delete `action.json`.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Mod polls for `action.json` each frame without impacting game performance when idle
- [ ] Each action kind routes to the correct `G.FUNCS.*` or card method call
- [ ] Card objects are located by `card.ID` matching, not by display position
- [ ] The actionable state set is defined as a named constant and covers all non-transitional states
- [ ] `action.json` is deleted only after `G.STATE` settles into the actionable set
- [ ] `action_error.json` is written with action kind and reason on any handler failure
- [ ] Queue processing halts at the first error; subsequent actions in the queue are not executed
- [ ] A real play-through of at least one full blind (select blind -> play hand to completion -> enter shop) works end-to-end

## Phase 4: Readiness-Gated Export Polling

**User stories**: 28, 29, 30, 31

### What to build

Modify `live_state_exporter` to stop treating `action.json` deletion as the sole trigger for canonical exports. Instead, the exporter should poll a very cheap readiness predicate in memory on each update, or at another equally cheap cadence, and only build the full observation when the game appears ready for player input.

The initial readiness predicate should prefer controller and action gates over expensive world reads: `not G.CONTROLLER.locked`, `not G.CONTROLLER.interrupt.focus`, and `(G.GAME.STOP_USE or 0) == 0`. If live testing shows that this still admits fragmented reads, the phase may add one or two tiny presence checks, but it should not fall back to a full-state stabilization loop or a global `T`/`VT` convergence scan.

When the predicate is false, the exporter does not promote a new canonical snapshot. When the predicate is true, it performs a normal `live_state.json` build/write. Startup still gets one unconditional initial write so Python has a baseline observation on boot.

Deduplication should remain in place for canonical output suppression: repeated ready snapshots that are identical should not cause extra writes. The old post-action dedupe/stability-window experiment is not revived; the goal is a cheap readiness gate plus normal canonical dedupe.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Exporter polls a cheap in-memory readiness predicate without building the full observation while the predicate is false
- [ ] The initial readiness predicate is controller-based: `not G.CONTROLLER.locked`, `not G.CONTROLLER.interrupt.focus`, and `(G.GAME.STOP_USE or 0) == 0`
- [ ] Canonical `live_state.json` writes occur only when the readiness predicate is true
- [ ] Startup write fires once on game load before any action has been submitted
- [ ] Canonical deduplication remains in place so identical ready snapshots do not cause extra writes
- [ ] Existing observation parser and smoke tests continue to pass against the new export behavior

---

## Phase 5: Reorder Actions

**User stories**: 19, 20, 21, 38, 40

### What to build

Add `reorder_jokers` and `reorder_hand` handlers to `ai_executor`. These cannot use `G.FUNCS.*` or `CardArea:sort()` since they require arbitrary ordering. Instead, each handler receives the full desired sequence as an `order` array of instance IDs, builds a new ordered table by matching each position to its card object via `card.ID`, assigns it back to `CardArea.cards`, and triggers a display refresh so the game renders the new order correctly.

If any instance ID in the `order` array is not found in the target area, the handler writes `action_error.json` and halts rather than performing a partial reorder. The `order` array must also contain exactly as many IDs as there are cards in the target area; a length mismatch is also an error.

The reorder logic is extracted into a testable helper function that can be exercised against a mock card table without a running game.

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `reorder_jokers` rearranges `G.jokers.cards` to match the declared `order` sequence
- [ ] `reorder_hand` rearranges `G.hand.cards` to match the declared `order` sequence
- [ ] Display refresh is triggered after reorder so the game renders the new order
- [ ] An unknown instance ID in `order` produces an error file and halts without partial reorder
- [ ] A length mismatch between `order` and the target area produces an error file and halts
- [ ] Reorder logic is tested against a mock card table independently of a running game
